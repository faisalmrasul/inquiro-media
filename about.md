# Inquiro Media Labs: Exploring and Building with AI #

Inquiro Media Labs is a place to explore artificial intelligence through hands-on building and real experimentation. We document our journey of creating AI-powered applications by working with large language models, custom logic, user interfaces, and automated workflows.

**The goal is simple:** to understand how generative AI becomes useful in the real world.

At Inquiro Media Labs, we develop end-to-end, AI-powered systems that support knowledge work. These systems are designed to be explainable and transparent, acting as collaborators rather than hidden black boxes.

Instead of hiding the process, we share it openly. We focus on how AI contributes to inquiry and where human judgment still matters most.


## Mission: ## 
To explore AI-powered tools that create real-world impact.

## Vision: ## 
To help people understand what AI can do across different domains and contribute to a more AI-aware future.
