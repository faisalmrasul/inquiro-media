# Inquiro Projects

Inquiro Projects is a collection of experimental, AI-powered applications developed at Inquiro Media Labs. The projects focus on building practical, human-centered tools for creators and knowledge workers by leveraging large language models while keeping human judgment at the core. 

**Our work emphasizes:**

•	Real-world usefulness over demos

•	Transparency and explainability in AI-assisted workflows

•	End-to-end systems, from prompts and logic to user interfaces
